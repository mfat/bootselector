This is a simple graphical utility to set default entry in GRUB.
It has only 2 functions:
1. Set default operating system/kernel (makes necessary changes to `/etc/default/grub`)
2. Reboot into any installed OS/kernel/UEFI firmware settings directly 


This has been tested on Ubuntu 24.10.
Use at your own risk.

### Note for Fedora/RHEL users
I'm planning to release a separate version for rpm-based systems. however you're welcome to test this and share feedback
